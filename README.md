# Generic-SpringBoot-API #

This project currently serves as a template spring API, build with gradle, with the following properties:

- Building with Circle CI (see circle.yml).
- Deployment with Heroku (see Procfile).

The project provides some generic spring-boot tooling, making use of generics to reduce the need for boilerplate code in spring-boot projects.

This project can be forked and refactored for use as the basis of other projects.

The project uses gradle as it's build tool, so that it can be forked directly as a quick-start project.

If you have any questions, please contact the project lead, Dan at daniel.pawsey@live.co.uk
